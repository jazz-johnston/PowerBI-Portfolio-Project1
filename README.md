Author: Jazz Johnston

Company: The company provides transportation and logistics services for the energy and mining sectors. It handles shipments of oil products, raw minerals, and industrial equipment across multiple regions.
Transportation is done through a multi-modal network — rail and sea for long-distance routes, trucks for regional deliveries, and air freight for urgent or high-value cargo.


▫️ 1. Reports goal: The report provides a comprehensive view of financial and operational performance for the logistics division.
It enables management to monitor revenue growth, profitability, delivery efficiency, and service reliability over time.
The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making by consolidating key KPIs across finance, operations, and customer service.

▫️ 2. Data Sources: Synthetic transaction data was used (Revenue, Plan Revenue, Cost, OTIF, Lead Time, Segments, Regions, Categories).

▫️ 3. Key metrics
• Revenue & Gross Margin (%) – measure overall business performance and profitability.
• OTIF % (On-Time In-Full) – tracks delivery reliability and service quality.
• Lead Time (days) – measures average shipment duration and operational efficiency.
• Revenue Achievement % & Variance to Plan – evaluate performance against business targets.
• On-Time Improvement % – shows year-over-year progress in delivery performance.
• Volume & Total Shipments – assess operational throughput and logistics capacity.

▫️ 4. Key insights
• In 2024, GM% consistently exceeded 50%, despite a slight decline in revenue.
• Average Lead Time increased by 0.2 days, which decreased OTIF% by 0.2 percentage points.
• The Chemicals category and the West region account for the largest contribution to delays.

▫️ 5. Tools and Methods
Power BI (DAX formulas, cross-page filtering, decomposition tree, key influencers).
Visualizations: KPI cards, Combo Charts, Treemap, Waterfall, Scatter, Decomposition Tree.

▫️ 6. Screenshots and page descriptions
